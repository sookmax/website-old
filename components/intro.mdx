Hi, my name's _Sukkyu_ (sounds like suÂ·**cue**)&mdash;or just call me _Sook_.

I was introduced to web technology when I was working as a data analyst. I quickly fell in love with it so much so that I decided to switch my career as a web developer.

And now I'm happy working as a web dev.

Thanks for visiting my website.
