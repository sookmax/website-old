Hi, my name's _Sukkyu_ (sounds like suÂ·**cue**)&mdash;or just call me _Sook_.

I'm fascinated by web technology, but more broadly, I'd say I'm interested in software engineering in general,
its best practices, and the positive values it could bring to society when done right.

I came to realize that software development is, rather a team effort&mdash;as opposed to individual's.

So, I put up this website to introduce myself with details in hopes of connecting with like-minded people like _you_.

Thanks for visiting my website.
