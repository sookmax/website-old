Hi, my name's _Sukkyu_ (sounds like suÂ·**cue**)&mdash;or just call me _Sook_.

I was introduced to web technology while working as a data analyst, and ever since that moment
I've been hooked.

But more broadly, I'd say I'm interested in software engineering in general,
its best practices, and the positive values it could bring to society when done right.

I came to realize that software development is rather a team effort as opposed to individual's.

So, I put up this website to introduce myself with details in hopes of connecting with people like _you_.

Thanks for visiting my website.
