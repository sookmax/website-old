Hi there! My name's _Sukkyu_ (sounds like suÂ·**cue**). But rather, just call me _Sook_!
It's easier for everybody and I prefer to be called that way.

I like web development, but really I'd say I like software engineering in general.

I put up this website in hopes of introducing myself in detail,
since getting to know someone deeply takes a long time&mdash;especially so, with limited information and feedbacks.

I came to realize that software development&mdash;those result in a real societal value&mdash;is rather a team effort.
So I'm always looking forward to connect with like-minded people, and given enough of that happens in the future,
I hope one day we could build something amazing together!
