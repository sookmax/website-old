Hi, my name's _Sukkyu_ (sounds like suÂ·**cue**)&mdash;or just call me _Sook_.

I was introduced to web technology when I was working as a data analyst. Then I quickly fell in love with it, so much so that I decided to switch my career as a web developer.

Web development aside, I also like learning about computer science fundamentals, software engineering in practice,
and the best practices of it including things like testing strategies and good engineering culture.

Thanks for visiting my website.
