As easy as it may sound, creating a website for me was actually quite challenging.

The biggest hurdle I immediately faced was figuring out a way to set up a workflow that allows me to write content in `markdown`,
see the result immediately in the browser when the file is saved, and produce static `html` at the end of the build process.

All I knew at the moment was creating a `React` app using `create-react-app` with very rudimentary `JavaScript` knowledge. And I just couldn't proceed from that
to the workflow I wanted.

I remember one time I tried using `MDX` on top of the `React` app bootstrapped with `create-react-app`, but found
it extremely difficult to get the list of blog posts _programatically_ without actually interacting with the file system&mdash;
which was beyond the scope of my `JavaScript` knowledge at the moment.

I also heard good things about `Gatsby` at that time around and what it was capable of,
but I just didn't want to invest additional time learning the framework&mdash;similar thing happened to my interest towards `Hugo`.

What's even more discouraging, my new job at the time&mdash;which is still my current job&mdash;required me to mainly use `three.js` and `Vue`, so I guess
I brushed off the idea of creating a personal website for a while for the sake of learning new things; `three.js` and `Vue`.

Now that my time at my current job is ending, I had enough room in my mind to revisit where I left off with `React`&mdash;after having experienced with both
`Vue2` and `Vue3` for about a year, strangly I'm still in favor of `React` and its community.

With a fresh mind, I took time to go through the new [React Docs Beta](https://beta.reactjs.org/), [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn/foundations/about-nextjs),
and even [Learn - unified](https://unifiedjs.com/learn/) for some extent.

With `Next.js`'s incredible `getStaticProps`, `getStaticPaths` and `dynamic routes` as well as tools around `MDX`,
I could finally achieve what I wanted&mdash;I write content in `markdown`, I check the actual render of my content in the browser in real time,
and the `markdown`s are compiled away to `html`s in the build time.

Things that `Next.js` and `Vercel` take care for us such as the _developer experience_, _web optimization_ and ease of _deployment_ are just mind-blowing.

Without `Next.js`, I wouldn't have persisted through the challenge of creating a website, and thus never would've had one.

So yeah, thank you [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/).
