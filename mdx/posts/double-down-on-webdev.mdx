title: Doubling down on web dev

My career shift from data analyst to frontend developer was kind of sudden and ill-prepared, in a sense that I just took the opportunity to become one at my previous job, and just sort of progressed from that.

Speaking of ill-preparedness, from day one I was looking at a _react_ code base even before I had any understanding of how _html_, _css_ and _javascript_ worked.

I sort of hoped for a while that if I worked hard enough at my current job, I'd eventually overcome my weak foundations.

Only soon enough did I realize that might not be the case, necessarily.

It seemed to me the demands from the job always exceeded my current capability and my current understanding of the techs, which often resulted in my writing some poor code that I wasn't particularly proud of.

By poor code I probably mean something like the ones that were stripped straight out of _stackoverflow_ answers with little to no attempt to understand how they actually worked, or like the code that were so hard to understand and debug&mdash;even for me who wrote them in the first place&mdash;mainly due to poor code structure and my limited proficiency in _JavaScript_.

I would, however, still produce those poor quality code from time to time anyway&mdash;at least unwillingly.. does that count?&mdash;to meet the time constraints of a particular task that I was assigned to at the moment, and make things work by then.

This never felt great.

Every time this happened I'd promise to myself to revisit the code later to understand them better and improve them.

Seldom did I keep my promise, as far as I remember.

It finally took a toll on me in my most recent job where I was expected to implement 3D-related stuff on the web with _three.js_.

I mean.. I barely understand how 2D works on the web, but now it's 3D?

It had never occurred to me to take a break from work just to improve my skills, because I thought they could be done simultaneously.

But I started to fancy that idea.

Then one day I finally decided.

I made up my mind to ditch my full-time job for about a year, and hone my skills instead&mdash;for what it's worth, I've tried multiple times to utilize my spare time for self-improvement but I found myself giving it up way too quickly mainly due to the burnout resulting from the work hours; I needed me some beers at night at least!.

Now that my day job is out of the way, what should I study for a year?

For a long time, this was my plan for the year, to follow the carefully curated materials presented in this wonderful website called, [Teach Yourself Computer Science](https://teachyourselfcs.com).

So It really pained me when I recently decided to alter my plan.

But it's not like a total abandonment. I'll make sure to find myself another time to go over the subjects in _teachyourselfcs_ in the future.

I've thought about it.

I haven't reached my financial freedom&mdash;not even close&mdash;and I'd still need a job after one year of not generating any income to sustain myself.

And I'm probably going to want to apply for a web dev position since that's where I have the most experience as a software engineer, and yeah I actually like web development a lot.

But my web dev game would still probably be where I am now if I spent the whole year focusing on CS fundamentals.
And the main reason I wanted to take a break from work in the first place was to become better at what I did, which is web dev.

So yeah I think it makes more sense to up my web dev game first before I dabble in CS stuff, at least for now.

And a tweet like this stirred my mind as well: [generalist vs specialist](https://twitter.com/brittanyellich/status/1581292879447617536?s=20&t=hwSQIV8tb-DS1P93sgCD7Q)

I want to be good at something.

I want to be good at web development to the point where I would be able to contribute to the web dev community and open source projects.

It's going to be an exciting year.

Because I'm doubling down on web dev.
