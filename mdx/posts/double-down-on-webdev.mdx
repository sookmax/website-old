title: Doubling down on web dev

My career shift from data analyst to frontend developer was kind of sudden and ill-prepared, in a sense that I just took the opportunity to become one at my previous job, and just sort of progressed from that.

Speaking of ill-preparedness, from day one I was looking at a _react_ code base even before I had any understanding of how html, css and javascript worked.

I sort of believed for a while that if I worked hard enough at my current job, I'd eventually overcome my weak foundation.

Only to realize that was not necessarily the case.

It seemed to me the demands from the job always exceeded my capability and understanding, which in many cases resulted in some poor implementations that I didn't like.

By poor implementations I probably mean something that are patched up here and there with some code snippets on the internet, of which I don't fully understand the mechanics.

I would, however, be half-forced to use them anyway to meet the time constrains of a particular task that I was assigned to, just for the sake of making it work.

This never felt great.

Every time this happened I'd promise to myself to revisit the implementation later to understand them better or come up with a better solution.

Seldom did I keep my promise, however.

It finally took a toll on me in my most recent job where I was expected to implement 3D-related stuffs on the web with _three.js_.

Man, I barely understand how 2D works on the web, but now it's 3D?

It had never occurred to me to take a break from work altogether to improve my skills, but I started to fancy that idea.

And then I finally made up my mind to put a halt to having a full-time job for about a year and hone my skills instead&mdash;I've tried multiple times to utilize my spare time for self-improvement but I found myself giving it up way too quickly mainly due to the burnout resulting from the work hours.

So yeah I'm quitting my day job.

Now that that's out of the way, what should I study for a year?

For a long time, this was my plan for the year, and I still think it's worth the time.

But I've changed my mind very recently.
