title: Doubling down on web dev
description: What I should be focusing on

In hindsight, my changing positions from a data analyst to a frontend developer was almost too easy because it was an internal transfer at a small, unorganized company.

As a data analyst, I had been using tools like _RStudio Server_ or _Jupyter Notebook_, and I was always intrigued by the fact that they ran in the browser.

- "How is it possible that I type an _R_ command or a _Python_ command in the browser and it evaluates and returns the value in respective languages?"
- "Is there a Python/R interpreter hidden inside the browser?"
- "I thought browsers only understand JavaScript.."

Questions remained. And more and more I wanted to understand the web.

The transition to frontend development was only possible because at the moment, my company was also actively developing a data analytics solution for our corporate clients, and our dev team desperately needed a perspective from a data analyst, the ultimate users of the solution that my company was building.

And I was just that, the ultimate user's perspective.

The internal transfer was as easy as moving my desk to the dev team's office&mdash;nobody seemed to care if I were familiar with web technology or if I knew what was expected for the new role.

It was both blessing and curse, but I was definitely not ready for the job.

---

Speaking of how ill-prepared I was, from day one I was looking at a _react_ code base even before I had any understanding of how _html_, _css_ and _javascript_ worked&mdash;I still find it funny whenever I think about how confused I was when I first looked at the _JSX_ syntax.

I desperately hoped for a while that if I worked hard enough at my current job, I'd eventually overcome my weak foundations.

Only soon did I realize that might not be the case, necessarily.

It seemed to me the demands from the job always exceeded my current capability and my current understanding of the fundamental web technologies, which forced me to rely on other people's solutions, unfamiliar libraries and frameworks, and often resulted in my writing some poor code that I wasn't particularly proud of.

By poor code I probably mean something like the ones that were stripped straight out of _stackoverflow_ answers with little to no attempt to understand how they actually worked, or like the code that were so hard to understand and debug&mdash;even for me who wrote them in the first place&mdash;mainly due to poor code structure and my limited proficiency in _JavaScript_; or in everything.

I would, however, still produce those poor quality code from time to time anyway&mdash;at least unwillingly.. does that count?&mdash;to meet the time constraints of a particular task that I was assigned to at the moment, and try to make things work by the deadline.

This never felt great.

Every time this happened I'd promise to myself to revisit the code later to understand them better and improve them.

Seldom did I keep my promise, as far as I remember.

It finally took a toll on me in my most recent job where I was expected to implement 3D-related stuff on the web with _three.js_.

I mean.. I barely understand how 2D works on the web, but now it's 3D?

In fact, I wasn't bad at my job. It's just that I wish I had more knowledge in 3D graphics when I was doing it.

It had never occurred to me to take a break from work just to improve my skills, because I thought skills would be improved naturally while working&mdash;they did so, however, only to the limited extent.

So I started to fancy that idea.

Then one day I finally decided.

I made up my mind to ditch my full-time job for about a year, and hone my skills instead&mdash;for what it's worth, I've many times tried to utilize my spare time for skill-improvement, but none of the attempts stuck with me long enough to produce a meaningful outcome.

Now that my day job is out of the way, what should I study for a year?

For a long time, this was my plan for the year, to follow the carefully curated materials presented in this wonderful website, [Teach Yourself Computer Science](https://teachyourselfcs.com).

So It really pained me when I recently decided to alter my plan.

But it's not like I'm entirely abandoning the idea. I still think it's important to learn fundamental CS, and I'll make sure to find myself another time to go over the subjects in _teachyourselfcs_ at some point in the future.

Now, I've thought about what I'm about to say, many times.

I haven't achieved financial freedom&mdash;barely&mdash;and so I'd still need a job, after one year of unemployment, to sustain myself.

And at the end of the study, I'm probably going to want to apply for a web-dev position since that's where I have the most experience as a software engineer, and yeah I actually like web development a lot.

But my web-dev skills would still probably be the same as of now&mdash;mediocre at best&mdash;if I spent the whole year focusing on CS subjects.
And so I might not be as competitive of a candidate for a web-dev position as I think I'd be at the end of the year

Studing CS is great, but it doesn't necessarily make you a better web developer in a short term.

That's my honest take.

So yeah I think it makes more sense to up my web-dev game first, before I dabble in CS stuff, at least for the near future.

Truth is, I want to be _really_ good at _something_.

And for now, I want to be _really_ good at _web development_.

It's going to be an exciting year.

Because I'm doubling down on web dev.
