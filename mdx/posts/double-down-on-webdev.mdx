In hindsight, I was able to change my career to frontend developer without much effort at least initially.

I was at this one company working as a data analyst, and sort of just switched my position to frontend developer, thanks to flexible internal transfer policy at that time.

As a data analyst, I had been using tools like _RStudio Server_ and _Jupyter Notebook_, and I was always intrigued by the fact that they ran in the browser.

- "How is it possible that I type an _R_ command or _Python_ command in the browser and it evaluates and returns the value in respective languages?"
- "Is there a Python or R interpreter hidden inside the browser?"
- "I thought browsers only understand JavaScript.."

Questions remained unresolved. And more and more I wanted to understand how the web worked.

The timing of the transfer couldn't have been more appropriate, because my company was actively developing a data analytics solution for our corporate clients, and our dev team desperately needed a perspective from data analysts, the expected users of our solution. And well, I sort of fit into that picture nicely.

I was both excited and worried to start working as a web developer. Interestingly, nobody in the dev team seemed to care if I were familiar with web technology or if I knew what was expected for the new role.

It didn't take long for me to realize how unprepared I was to do the job.

From day one, I was looking at a _React.js_ code base even before I had any understanding of how _html_, _css_ and _javascript_ worked&mdash;I still find it funny when I think about how confused I was, looking at _JSX_ syntax all day.

A few weeks in, I was surprised how little the required knowledge was to complete a small task like changing styles of a small UI component. So I was able to get by, only focusing on the narrow context that was relevant to my assignments, treating everything else as a black box.

But my curious mind felt uneasy not knowing how the black box worked. So every spare moment I got, I would start searching how things _really_ worked.

Well, it turned out that understanding how things really worked was incomparably harder than completing my assignments. All I managed to understand was that what's actually powering our frontend project was these scary-sounding javascript libraries; _Webpack_, _Babel_, _Redux_, _Reselect_, _Sass_, etc. And actually, reading their documentations left me even more confused.

I occasionally asked our team lead about how things really worked under the hood, only to receive an answer that was either very hard to understand because he used a lot of other jargons that I was not familiar with, or he didn't know also.

One day while my curious mind was searching for answers online, I accidently found [a Github project](https://github.com/erikras/react-redux-universal-hot-example) that looked suspiciously similar to our frontend project&mdash;later I learned our project used this github repo as a boilerplate and grew from there. That was when I started to suspect, _"maybe understanding how things really work is hard for everybody."_ And I was expecting, _"maybe as I gain more experience in web development my understanding of lower level stuff would increase naturally as well."_

Well it did, to only a limited extent, but still the actual mechanics of _Webpack_, _Babel_, and _React_ were still largly a mystery. The gap between what I wrote in the IDE and the actual _html_, _css_, and _javascript_ that were running in the browser didn't seem to be getting any closer.

And these uncomfortable thoughts started to emerge in my mind,

_"Maybe I'll never be able to understand these lower-level javascript libraries if I continue working as a web application developer, no matter how many years pass."_

_"And if things change in the future, and other libraries gain popularity, and the industry expects web developers to know how to use them, I might have to learn them all over again."_

_"What I now know about how to use React might not be too helpful for me to learn another popular framework in the future."_

_"When we use frameworks, are we really learning core fundamentals of the web? or are we just getting used to a particular way of doing things and a set of particular syntaxes?"_

These questions eventually led me to start thinking,

_"What differentiates the authors of frameworks and the rest of us, the users of the frameworks?"_

_"Are they all born geniuses who started programming in their early ages?"_

_"Maybe they all have very solid foundations in computer science, to create something like a javascript framework."_

That's actually what I have believed for a long time; one needs to have a solid understanding of computer science fundamentals to create something like _React_. So I was going to take a year off of work and study CS fundamentals, following this wonderful website: [teachyourselfcs](https://teachyourselfcs.com/).

While it's certainly the case for a lot of framework authors to have a strong CS background, and I still think it's invaluable to learn CS fundamentals as someone pursuing career in software engineering, I have also found many counterexamples to my assumptions. People like [Evan You](https://twitter.com/youyuxi) and [Rich Harris](https://twitter.com/Rich_Harris), they don't seem to have a very strong computer science background, and yet they've created some incredible javascript tools and frameworks that people love.

As I found more and more counterexamples, I was more and more convinced that focusing soly on web development would be the way to go&mdash;time as a resource was also a huge factor to consider. I can only afford about a year or two without an income, and by the time I get back to job market, I want to be a better web developer.

So here I am again&mdash;this time with an abundance of free time&mdash;trying to understand how things _really_ work under the hood.

It's going to be an exciting year, because I'm doubling down on web dev.
