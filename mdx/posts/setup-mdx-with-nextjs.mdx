title: Setting up MDX with Next.js

For a personal website like this, I think setting up a comfortable way to write text-based contents is important.

And of course when it comes to writing on the web, `markdown` format gives you far better experience than writing an article in `html tags`.

While writing contents in `markdown` is already good enough for most cases, `MDX` offers something even better _on top of_ what `markdown` is already capable of.

> MDX allows you to use JSX in your markdown content. You can import components, such as interactive charts or alerts, and embed them within your content. This makes writing long-form content with components a blast. ðŸš€

Pay attention to this part of the statement again:  
"You can import components, such as interactive charts ..."

I'll show you just that!

So I think it's always better to set up `MDX` environment whenever possible, rather than plain `markdown` environment if you're planning to write text-based contents for your website.

So how do we set this up in `Next.js` app?

Basic idea is very similar to that of [Next.js official tutorial](https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/create-nextjs-app), in which they show us how to build a blog app with `Next.js`.

- Read the content of `.mdx` file in `getStaticProps()`
- Serialize the loaded mdx content and return as one of the `props` in `getStaticProps()`
- Process the `props` passed from `getStaticProps()` in the actual `React Component`.

The most non-trivial part of this process is to serialize and deserialize the mdx content.

Fortunately, a wonderful library called, [next-mdx-remote](https://github.com/hashicorp/next-mdx-remote) handles this seamlessly.

Let's examine the example code below:

```jsx title="next-mdx-remote#examples"
import { serialize } from "next-mdx-remote/serialize";
import { MDXRemote } from "next-mdx-remote";

import Test from "../components/test";

const components = { Test };

export default function TestPage({ source }) {
  return (
    <div className="wrapper">
      <MDXRemote {...source} components={components} />
    </div>
  );
}

export async function getStaticProps() {
  // MDX text - can be from a local file, database, anywhere
  const source = "Some **mdx** text, with a component <Test />";
  const mdxSource = await serialize(source);
  return { props: { source: mdxSource } };
}
```

If we look at `getStaticProps()` first&mdash;place where the serialization of MDX should occur&mdash;we can identify it's handled by `serialize()` function from `next-mdx-remote/serialize`, and the serialized MDX source is returned as one of the `props`.

Next, in the actual React Component of the page `TestPage`, we see that it takes the serialized MDX content passed by `getStaticProps()` and pass it to `MDXRemote` component from `next-mdx-remote`.

And that's pretty much it.

The original MDX source `Some **mdx** text, with a component <Test />` will be correctly transformed to React Elements inside `<MDXRemote />` and eventually be rendered as DOM nodes in the browser.

One caveat when using a custom React Component in your MDX file with this approach is that you cannot use `import/export` statements in your MDX file, but rather you must provide your React Components to `<MDXRemote />`:

```jsx
import { MDXRemote } from "next-mdx-remote";

import Test from "../components/test";

const components = { Test };

export default function TestPage({ source }) {
  return (
    <div className="wrapper">
      <MDXRemote {...source} components={components} />
    </div>
  );
}
```

This is because `next-mdx-remote` allows you to pull your MDX source not only from your local directory but also from anywhere remote where the contents are saved&mdash;if the content is coming from some remote storage, not from your project's sub-directory, a path-based `import/export` would not really make sense. (see: [import/export](https://github.com/hashicorp/next-mdx-remote#import--export))

One more thing before wrapping up.

If you use `<MDXProvider />` in your project already, you can also pass your custom Component along with your other Components to it instead:

```jsx title="my_next_project/pages/_app.jsx"
import { MDXProvider } from "@mdx-js/react";
import Test from "../components/test";

const components = {
  img: ResponsiveImage,
  h1: Heading.H1,
  h2: Heading.H2,
  p: Text,
  pre: Pre,
  code: InlineCode,
  Test, // this doesn't have to be an MDX component (https://mdxjs.com/table-of-components/#components)
};

export default function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {
  return (
    <MDXProvider components={components}>
      <Component {...pageProps} />
    </MDXProvider>
  );
}
```
