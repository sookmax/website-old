title: Personal website

Even long before I was introduced to web development, I'd always wanted to have my personal website.

To me, there was always something magical about websites in a sense that
they can be accessed from anywhere at anytime with any device supporting a web browser.

A personal website is also very different from social media platforms in that
its contents are, in general, _minimally_ exposed&mdash;they don't show up in someone else's feed
just because you write them.

This feature of being minimally exposed while still publically accessible makes a personalized website
very attractive&mdash;I can write my own thoughts and opinions without
feeling as self-conscious as I would when posting something on social media.

As much as I liked to go ahead and set up a personal website already, my journey of doing so has not always been
satisfactory&mdash;most of the time, I felt frustrated
when the solution or the framework that I went with to create a website didn't allow me to
make changes to the style or the layout with complete freedom.
There always seemed to be some kind of restrictions&mdash;and rightfully so.

As my understanding of how website works became better, I came to realize the amount of effort that's required to make
a good-looking, smooth-feeling, and responsive website is not trivial at all.
I began to identify and appreciate small little things in website UI&mdash;as small as buttons and icons&mdash;that
I previously took for granted while surfing the web.
I didn't know they were the culmination of hard engineering work, and rather thought of them as
something just worked by default&mdash;maybe we are kind of spoiled as end users in that sense
(social media platforms, among many others, have raised the standard too high!).

With this realization though, unfortunately this weird sense of discouragement also came along.
Now that I know how much effort should be put in to make a beautiful website, I was just overwhelmed even before the start
and just didn't want to go through all the hard work.

I definitely needed some external help.

I needed some tools whose abstractions are low enough that I could do whatever I want, but simultaneously
take care of the things that I'm not capable of doing myself but very important regardless.

After some time passed while I was busy learning `React.js` for the first time,
I accidentally stumbled upon `Next.js` website.
At first sight, I didn't really understand what it was for&mdash;I thought to myself, why another framework
on top of `React.js`?&mdash;so I decided to give it a shot and followed their tutorial.

And there, I had a small epiphany of how it was possible to write a text content in a `markdown` format and
load it as a React Component. It was an eye-opening experience for me since
it had always been unclear how markdown files were eventually transformed into html documents at the end
of the build process of various frameworks I'd come across&mdash;later
I learned the transformations were carried by `unified` processor and its wonderful plugin ecosystems
such as `remark`, `rehype` and `MDX`.

In a similar time period, I also discovered this incredible project that lets you style your React Component
with various utility classes, called `tailwindcss`. It does not give you any ready-made widgets and components per se,
but it gives you a lot of useful pre-defined CSS classes that are essentially as much low-level as each individual CSS property.
`tailwindcss` empowers you to create your own widgets and components with a superior DX
compared to writing plain CSS&mdash;I actually ended up learning a lot more about CSS itself while using `tailwindcss`.

So it seems like I have finally found all the right tools to create a long-awaited, personally-tailored website:

- `React.js` for creating a dynamic and interactive web page.
- `Next.js / Vercel` for all the necessary web optimizations and efficient deployment.
- `tailwindcss` for styling.
- `MDX` for content writing.

It actually took me quite a while to put them all together, but it was all worthwhile.

I've found the right tools.

Now I'm a happy man.
