title: MDX with live reload

If you set up an `MDX` environment in your `Next.js` project with `next-mdx-remote` ([related post](/post/setup-mdx-with-nextjs)), unfortunately you will immediately notice your browser doesn't refresh when you save your MDX file.

This is because when you use `next-mdx-remote` to load up your MDX files, you don't explicitly import the MDXs anywhere in your project so `Next.js` doesn't know something has been updated. ([see here for more info](https://github.com/hashicorp/next-remote-watch#next-remote-watch))

Lucky for us, the same author who created `next-mdx-remote` also made a library called `next-remote-watch` that helps us achieve the live-reload as we change our MDX files.

Installation and setup is actually pretty easy:

```
npm i -D next-remote-watch
```

This installs the cli, `next-remote-watch` and per documentation, it's a drop-in replacement for your `next dev` command.

The cli takes file paths as its positional arguments so if your MDX files are located in, say `./mdx`, you can run the cli like below:

```
npx next-remote-watch ./mdx
```

Or you can add an npm script:

```json title="package.json"
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "next dev",
    "dev:watch": "next-remote-watch ./mdx"
  }
}
```

One important caveat is that `next-remote-watch` is said to rely on some undocumented APIs of `Next.js` [(see here)](https://github.com/hashicorp/next-remote-watch#important-warnings-and-caveats), it might break if you update your `Next.js` version in the future&mdash;I've confirmed it works with `next@12.3.1` which is the current latest as of 10/20/2022.

So It'd be safer not to overwrite your existing `npm dev script` and just create another script like `dev:watch` above. (this is also suggested here: [MDX Remote Example](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-mdx-remote#mdx-remote-example)).

Now, if you run `npm run dev:watch` instead of `npm run dev`&mdash;assuming your script is configured like above&mdash;and save one of your MDX files after editing, you'll see your browser will refresh automatically.

And that's how you get auto-refresh feature when you're using `next-mdx-remote`!

If you're still here and want to have something even faster and pleasant than a full browser refresh, there's actually a way to do a _fast refresh_ per [Dan Abramov's comment](https://github.com/hashicorp/next-remote-watch/issues/42#issue-1362425425).

I use his suggested workaround for this website as well, and it's been working quite well so far without any major issue.

One hurdle to use this solution is that it requires you to modify `next-remote-watch` source code, so you have to find a way to use this _modified version_ in your project, not through the officially released package in `npm`.

I personally solved this by forking the `next-remote-watch` repo, and including this fork as a `git submodule` of my website repo. And then I use `npm workspace` feature to use this modified `next-remote-watch` in my website project's npm script.

This way I could pull the updates from the upstream repo (the original) if necessary while enjoying the modification I made to the fork.

Feel free to check out my repo if you're interested in setting this up: [sookmax/website](https://github.com/sookmax/website).
