title: MDX with live reload

If you set up an `MDX` environment in your `Next.js` project with `next-mdx-remote` ([related post](/post/setup-mdx-with-nextjs)), unfortunately you will immediately notice your browser doesn't refresh when you save your MDX file.

It would be very frustrating if the only way to trigger the browser update was to manually refresh your browser every time you save your MDX content.
