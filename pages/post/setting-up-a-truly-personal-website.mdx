title: Setting up a (truly) personal website

Even long before I became a web developer, I'd always wanted to have my personal website.
To me, there was always something magical about public websites in a sense that
they can be accessed from anywhere and anytime with any device supporting a web browser.

Unfortunately back then, I virtually had no idea how internet worked&mdash;other than well,
typing a domain name in the address bar. Even when I finally started to slowly understand
how things work on the internet, stuff like styling a website to my taste, adding interactivity and animations to it, hosting it somewhere
with a custom domain name, configuring SSL, etc. still was a big hurdle.

So inevitably I fell into this bad cycle of looking for one of those "battery-included" solutions for creating a website, playing and tinkering with the framework for some time,
and eventually abandoning the project due to the limited degrees of freedom in terms of customization.
They just didn't feel like _my own website_.

This was clearly not working.

The only way to have a complete control over a website was to dive into lower levels of abstractions,
and gather tools and ingredients of my own choice, and come up with my own recipe.

After some time passed while I was busy learning `React.js`, I accidentally stumbled upon `Next.js` website.
At first sight, I didn't really grasp what it was for, so I decided to give it a shot and followed their tutorial.

And there, I found a glimpse of hope that showed me how it was possible to write a text content in a `markdown` and
load it as a React Component. It was an eye-opening experience for me since
it had always been unclear how markdown files were eventually transformed into html document at the end of the process&mdash;later
I learned the transformations were actually carried by `unified` processor and its wonderful plugin ecosystems such as `remark`, `rehype` and powerful `MDX`.

In a similar time period, I also discovered this incredible open source project
called `tailwindcss`. It's not "battery-included" at all, but provides a lot of useful utility classes that are
essentially as low level as each individual CSS property. `tailwindcss` empowers you to create your own "battery" with a superior DX compared to
writing plain CSS.

Okay! so it seems like I've found all the right ingredients to create a truly personalized website:

- `React.js` for creating a dynamic and interactive web page.
- `Next.js / Vercel` for all the web optimizations, efficient deployment and web infrastructure.
- `tailwindcss` for superior styling experience.
- `MDX` for superior content writing.

It actually took me quite a while to put them all together, but it was all worthwhile since
now I have a full control over my own website.

I feel like I own a small corner of this vast surface of the internet. How cool is that?

export default function MDX({ children }) {
  return (
    <Article title={title} date={date}>
      {children}
    </Article>
  );
}
