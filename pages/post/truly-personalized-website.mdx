Even long before I became a web developer, I'd always wanted to have my personal website.

To me, there was always something magical about websites in a sense that
they can be accessed from anywhere at anytime with any device supporting a web browser.

A personal website is also very different from social media platforms in that
its contents are, in general, _minimally_ exposed&mdash;they don't show up in someone else's feed
just because you write them.

This feature of being minimally exposed while publically accessible makes a personalized website very attractive&mdash;I can
write my own thoughts and opinions without feeling as self-conscious as I would when posting something on social media.

As much as I'd like to go ahead and set up a personal website already, my journey of doing so has not always been satisfactory&mdash;most of the time, I've felt frustrated
when the solution or the framework that I went with to make my website didn't allow me to make changes to the contents, the style or the layout of the website with complete freedom.

There always seemed to be some kind of restrictions.

I mean, how can you call something your own if you don't have a full control over it?

What I wanted was my _own_ website.

Then, I came to the conclusion that the only legitimate way to make my dream come true was to dive further down into lower levels of abstractions,
and gather tools and ingredients of my own choice, and come up with my own recipe to build a website.

After some time passed while I was busy learning `React.js` for the first time, I accidentally stumbled upon `Next.js` website.
At first sight, I didn't really grasp what it existed for, so I decided to give it a shot and followed their tutorial.

And there, I found a glimpse of hope that showed me how it was possible to write a text content in a `markdown` and
load it as a React Component.

It was an eye-opening experience for me since
it had always been unclear how markdown files were eventually transformed into html document at the end of the build process of aforementioned solutions&mdash;later
I learned the transformations were actually carried by `unified` processor and its wonderful plugin ecosystems such as `remark`, `rehype` and `MDX`.

In a similar time period, I also discovered this incredible open source project
called `tailwindcss`. It does not give you any ready-made widgets and components per se, but it provides a lot of useful utility classes that are
essentially as low level as each individual CSS property. `tailwindcss` empowers you to create your own said widgets and components with a superior DX
compared to writing plain CSS&mdash;I actually learned a lot more about CSS while using `tailwindcss`.

So it seems like _finally_ I've found all the right ingredients to create a truly personalized website:

- `React.js` for creating a dynamic and interactive web page.
- `Next.js / Vercel` for all the web optimizations, efficient deployment and web infrastructure.
- `tailwindcss` for styling.
- `MDX` for content writing.

It actually took me quite a while to put them all together, but it was all worthwhile since
now I have a full control over my own website.

Now I'm a happy man.

export default function MDX({ children }) {
  return (
    <Article title={title} date={date}>
      {children}
    </Article>
  );
}
