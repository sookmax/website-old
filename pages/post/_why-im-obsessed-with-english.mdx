title: Why I'm obsessed with English

English is not my first language, but I can confidently say it's my primary and preferred language to use
in any occasion possible, and frankly it's the only language that I'm interested improving further.

I think the true power of English comes from the fact that It's practically a de facto language of any significant human knowledge
including science&mdash;you'd be able to find any knowledge/information you seek, whether it's written or spoken, in English
but I suppose, same cannot be said to any other human languages.

This has a very positive reinforcing effect in that people start seeking knowledge in English&mdash;having realized it's better that way&mdash;and
they eventually become proficient enough in English so they start contributing to the subject and the community
they're involved in, again in English.

And once a language becomes this powerful, I think it's very hard for another language to take over the throne.
Because learning a language takes a lot of time.

If everyone has already invested so much of their time learning English, would they be willing to learn another language
just because one day, one country and its language becomes suddenly dominant geopolitically?

I don't think so&mdash;the switching cost is already too high.

But I think that's a good thing.

It's good because we have a stable world language that has accumulated enormous power already and is
not going to be dethroned any time soon.

And think about how bigger your own world would get if you speak English. You can make friends and meaningful connections
among more than 1.2 billion people around the world&mdash;according to the chart above.

So yes, that's why I think It's worthwhile to invest time in learning English as a non-native speaker,
especially if you're a curious person who enjoys learning new things
because again, it's _the language_ of knowledge&mdash;whether we like it or not.
